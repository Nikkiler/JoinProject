<h1>Topic 1.1 Number systems</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In computer science, there are two extra number systems used.</p>
<p>These are: Binary (Base 2)
    and Hexadecimal (Base 16)</p>
<p>The reason we use these are stated below:
    
    Binary:
    Binary consists of 1 and 0 and is used because this is the only number system a computer can only understand.
    
    Hexadecimal:
    Hex consists of the characters 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F and is used because it is the midpoint between denary (base 10) and Binary.
    This means it is easy to translate from Binary to Hex and Hex to Denary.
